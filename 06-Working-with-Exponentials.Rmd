### All Numbers Great and Small

Standard form is a notation that has been developed to cope with the fact that we need to deal with both very large and very small numbers.

Take the scientist as an example, she may be involved in measuring the length of a micro organism or bacterium. Usually scientists will use a unit that is appropriate to the context, a typical bacterium might be 180 *microns* long. But we need to be able to relate these units to familiar measurement systems such as meters. 

In fact 1 *micron* is equal to 1 *micrometer* ($1 \mu m = 0.000001 m$). Other tiny units suitable for the atomic scale are *nanometers* ($1 nm = 0.000000001m$). All of these zeroes lead to increased potential for mistakes so we have adopted a notation called **standard form** to track the *place value* of the numbers we deal with.

Take $1 \mu m$ for example, in standard form this is $1\times10^{-6}m$ and on your calculator this might be displayed as $1\text{EXP}-06$  or in a spreadsheet as $1\text{E}-06$. What it means is to calculate:
$$1\times10^{-6}=\frac{1}{10^6}=\frac{1}{1000000}=0.000001$$

This gives us a very powerful and compact notation for very small numbers and also avoids errors by being clear about which decimal place the number is in.

e.g. $5.7 \mu m = 5.7\times10^{-6}=0.0000057$
Notice in this example that the $5$ lands in the 6th decimal place and the $7$ that was after the decimal point in $\mu m$ still comes just after the $5$.

Incredibly large numbers can also be handled by using *positive* powers of ten. For example a scientist measuting the distance to the (Andromeda Galaxy)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy] might do so in *Astronomical Units* (AU). One AU is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun ($1.496\times10^{11}m$). On this measurement the Andromeda Galaxy is $1.625\times10^{11}$ AU away from us. This figure is incredibly large equal to $16250000000 AU$, in other words $16250000000$ times farther away from us than the sun is.
