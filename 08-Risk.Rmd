# Risk

## Probability

Key Skills:
- u1 Be able to identify relevant equally likely outcomes in appropriate contexts.
- u2 Be able to count equally likely outcomes in appropriate contexts and hence estimate a probability.
- u3 Be able to estimate probability from long-run relative frequency.
- u4 Be able to interpret two-way tables and use them to calculate or estimate probability.
- u5 Understand the difference between dependent and independent events and be able to calculate probability in simple cases.
- u6 Be able to work with a tree diagram when calculating or estimating a probability, including conditional probability.

## Risk

Key Skills:
- u7 Understand risk given as a probability or as 1 in n or as a description such as “once in n years”.
- u8 Be able to interpret a risk assessment, understanding that it involves measures of both likelihood and impact.
