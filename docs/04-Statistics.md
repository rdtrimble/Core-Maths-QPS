# Statistics

## The statistics cycle

Key Skills:

- s1 Be able to decide what data need to be collected in order to answer a question requiring statistical evidence.
- s2 Be able to use a suitable method for collecting data, taking ethical considerations into account, and judge whether data are of sufficient quality.
- s3 Be able to process and present the data and so provide an answer to the original question.
- s4 Be able to interpret the answer to the question and decide whether it is realistic.

## Data

Key Skills:

- s5 Understand and use the language describing types of data.
- s6 Be able to recognise values in primary or secondary data which are unlikely to be accurate.
- s7 Be able to read information from a table and to construct a table to present information.
- s8 Understand the meaning of the terms sample and population.
- s9 Be able to interpret sample data in terms of possible properties of the parent population.
- s10 Understand about the variability of data and be able to describe the main features of a distribution.
- s11 Be able to use and interpret statistical diagrams appropriate to a variety of types of data.


## Statistical diagrams and measures

Key Skills:

- s12 Be able to identify when a statistical diagram is misleading and explain how it could be improved.
- s13 Be able to identify skewness from a histogram, frequency chart or box and whisker plot.
- s14 Be able to interpret a scatter diagram for bivariate data, draw a line of best fit by eye when it is appropriate to do so and understand that extrapolation might not be justified.
- s15 Be able to select and calculate appropriate measures of central tendency and to interpret them.
- s16 Be able to use appropriate measures of spread and to interpret them.
- s17 Be able to calculate a weighted mean and recognise when it is appropriate to do so.


## The Normal Distribution

Key Skills:

- s18 Know that the Normal distribution is a model which can be used for real data and recognise a Normal curve.
- s19 Know that, for a Normal distribution, values more than three standard deviations from the mean are very unusual; know that approximately 95% of the data lie within two standard deviations of the mean and that 68% (just over two thirds) lie within one standard deviation of the mean.
- s20 Be able to use mean and standard deviation to calculate a z-score and use z-scores for comparison or quality control.
- s21 Be able to interpret a Normal probability plot from statistical software.
