# Working with Graphs and Gradients

## Graphs

Key Skills:

- g1 Know that the independent variable is plotted on the horizontal axis of a graph.
- g2 Be able to construct a table of values for a graph from a simple formula and use it to plot the graph.
- g3 Be able to use a graph to construct a table of values.
- g4 Be able to work with graphs drawn from a variety of contexts.
- g5 Recognise graphs of direct and inverse proportion.
- g6 Be able to linearise the graph of a relationship where the dependent variable is directly proportional to some function of the independent variable.
- g7 Understand the relationship between a straight line graph and the formula connecting the variables graphed.

## Gradients

Key Skills:

- g8 Be able to find the gradient of a straight line graph and interpret it in context, taking account of the scales on the axes and using appropriate units.
- g9 Be able to estimate the gradient of a curve at a point by drawing a tangent and interpret it as a rate of change.
